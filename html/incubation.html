                   <h2>COVID-19 INCUBATION PERIOD:</h2>
                   <p>The incubation period (time from exposure to the development of symptoms) of the virus is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days based on the following sources:

                    The World Health Organization (WHO) reported an incubation period for COVID-19 between 2 and 10 days.
                    Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission (NHC) had initially estimated an incubation period from 10 to 14 days.
                    The United States' CDC estimates the incubation period for COVID-19 to be between 2 and 14 days.
                    DXY.cn, a leading Chinese online community for physicians and health care professionals, is reporting an incubation period of "3 to 7 days, up to 14 days".
                    The estimated range will be most likely narrowed down as more data becomes available.
                    
                    Incubation period of up to 24 days?
                    The incubation period has been found to be as long as 24 days (range: 0-24 days; median: 3.0 days) in a study published on February 9.
                    
                    The WHO said in a press conference on February 10 that:<br>
                    <ul>
                  <li> a very long incubation period could reflect a double exposure.</li>
                   <li> 24 days represented an outlier observation that must be taken into consideration in the context of the main finding of the study.</li>
                   <li> WHO is not considering changing recommendations regarding incubation periods.</li>
                    </ul>
                    More recently, however, a case with an incubation period of 19 days was observed in a JAMA study published on Feb. 21. [13], and another case with an incubation period of 27 days was reported by Hubei Province on Feb. 22 </p>
